A GitHub Action that zips and uploads build artifacts to an AWS S3 bucket, simplifying CI/CD workflows by automating artifact storage.

## üìå Overview

This action ensures seamless integration of build artifacts into your CI/CD pipeline by packaging and storing them in an S3 bucket.

## ‚ú® Features

- üì¶ Compresses build artifacts into a ZIP file
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Uploads artifacts securely to AWS S3
- üîÑ Optimized for CI/CD workflows
- üõ°Ô∏è Secure authentication with AWS credentials

## Usage

To use this action in your GitHub workflow, add the following step to your `workflow.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Upload Build Artifact to S3
  uses: anilrajrimal1/artifact-uploader@v1.0.0
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
    project-name: ${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}
    s3-base-path: "s3://your-bucket-name"
    source-directory: "./dist"
```

## üîß Inputs

| Name                   | Required | Default      | Description                                     |
|------------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `aws-access-key-id`    | ‚úÖ Yes   | -            | AWS access key ID for authentication           |
| `aws-secret-access-key`| ‚úÖ Yes   | -            | AWS secret access key for authentication       |
| `aws-region`          | ‚úÖ Yes   | `ap-south-1` | AWS region where the S3 bucket is located      |
| `project-name`        | ‚úÖ Yes   | -            | Project name used for organizing artifacts     |
| `s3-base-path`        | ‚úÖ Yes   | -            | Base S3 path where artifacts will be stored   |
| `source-directory`    | ‚ùå No    | `dist`       | Directory containing files to zip and upload  |

## üîÑ How It Works

1. Configures AWS credentials securely.
2. Creates a ZIP archive of the specified `source-directory`.
3. Uploads the ZIP file to the designated S3 path.
4. Outputs the final S3 location of the uploaded artifact.

## Security Notes

- Store your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as GitHub Secrets.
- Never hardcode sensitive credentials in workflow files.
- Uses AWS best practices for secure authentication.

## Requirements

- GitHub Actions runner with AWS CLI installed.
- AWS creds with proper permissions for S3
